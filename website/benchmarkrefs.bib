  computers is growing rapidly, with significant implications for the
  design and implementation of algorithms in scientific computing.
  I present the results of a broad survey of memory bandwidth and machine
  balance for a large variety of current computers, including uniprocessors,
  vector processors, shared-memory systems, and districuted-memory
  systems. The results are analyzed in terms of the sustainable data
  transfer rates for uncached unit-stride vector operation for each
  machine, and for each class.},

Benchmark Suite},

address = {New York, NY, USA},
abstract = {Benchmarks are essential in the design of modern HPC installations, as they define key aspects of system components. Beyond synthetic workloads, it is crucial to include real applications that represent user requirements into benchmark suites, to guarantee high usability and widespread adoption of a new system. Given the significant investments in leadership-class supercomputers of the exascale era, this is even more important and necessitates alignment with a vision of Open Science and reproducibility.
In this work, we present the JUPITER Benchmark Suite, which incorporates 16 applications from various domains. It was designed for and used in the procurement of JUPITER, the first European exascale supercomputer. We identify requirements and challenges and outline the project and software infrastructure setup. We provide descriptions and scalability studies of selected applications and a set of key takeaways. The JUPITER Benchmark Suite is released as open source software with this work at \href{https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/jubench}{\url{github.com/FZJ-JSC/jubench}}. },
